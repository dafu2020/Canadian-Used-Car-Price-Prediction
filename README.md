# Canadian-Used-Car-Price-Prediction
The used car dealers industry is constantly under-estimated. But in fact, it has huge market potential. As reported by IBISWorld, the market size, measured by revenue, of the Used Car Dealers industry in Canada is $14.3bn in 2021. This market is expecting continuous growth in 2022 as well. This market contains a large variety of used vehicles. I think it would be interesting to analyze the Canadian used car market and make models to predict the used car prices.
